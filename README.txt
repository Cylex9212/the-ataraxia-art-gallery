Hello there! This is a simple art gallery application I've made using Javascript, named after a story I'm writing "The Ataraxia"!

There's a lot of stuff you can do on this website:
  1. Login/Sign Up/Logout
  2. View all the artwork stored in the database
  3. Search for specific artwork by name/category/artist/medium
  4. View your account information
    4a. Change your username/password
    4b. View the people whom you are following
    4c. Change your 'user status', which basically means you can become an artist, or choose to not be an artist any more.
  5. View a specific piece of art
    5a. Like the artwork, increasing the number of likes it has
    5b. Comment on the artwork, leave a review!
    5c. Go to the artist's page
  6. View an artist's page
    6a. See all of the artwork they've made and posted!
    6b. Follow them!
  7. Post new artwork (only works if you're an artist!)
  8. And some more features I probably forgot to include!
    
As you can see, it's quite basic actually. But it's my first big project, so it means a lot to me!

Perhaps I'll update this thing some day, to make it better!

If you want to see the website in action, I've made a video on it (It's not the most professional, my apologies...!):

You can also do the following in order to run it (I used visual studio code, so the process might be different if you use another application):
  1. Type: 'npm install' in the terminal, so that you can install all the modules required to run the website server
  2. Type ‘node database-initializer.js’ in the terminal, this will set up your database
  3. Now, you can type: 'node store-server.js' in order to run the server
  4. Feel free to browse as you please!
